Homework assignment from my good friend maze which is already long overdue


hi maze,








this is so much fun but my brain feels like mush

requirements:
1. save this shit to a json
2. make a function which converts json into csv
i'll provide an example how converted csv should look like
3. function which can add new people to json file
4. same function for csv
5. function which prints out information about a person given the persons name
6. function which prints out the names of all people who know the provided language
7. all of the functions need to work as a menu
e.g. you choose one action something happens, you choose another one something else happens. the code stops working when you enter a specific character

Use Instructions:

for anyone who is not either me or maze, you can run this program by downloading the JSON and main.py files and running the "convert()" function, this creates a CSV file based on data taken from the JSON file. I promise i'll do proper in-code documentation when i get around to it, i don't have the time to make the code pretty.
