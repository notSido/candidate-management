Homework assignment from my good friend maze which is already long overdue


hi maze,








this is so much fun but my brain feels like mush

requirements:
1. save this shit to a json
2. make a function which converts json into csv
i'll provide an example how converted csv should look like
3. function which can add new people to json file
4. same function for csv
5. function which prints out information about a person given the persons name
6. function which prints out the names of all people who know the provided language
7. all of the functions need to work as a menu
e.g. you choose one action something happens, you choose another one something else happens. the code stops working when you enter a specific character
